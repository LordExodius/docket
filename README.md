- [dist](dist/) holds all html, css, compiled js, and bundled modules (using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/))

## Todo
There's a lot of improvements and features I'd like to add, and feature requests are always welcome. 

Here's a few things that I have in mind:
- **Editor Features**
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common markdown actions (bold, italic, etc.)
  - Import/export markdown files 
    - This might not be possible due to restrictions on file access in chrome extensions
    - Also, just paste the markdown into the editor, dummy ü•±
- **Autosave**
  - Query chrome storage when a user refocuses the tab or extension to prevent overwriting changes when multiple instances of docket are open
- **Settings**
  - Change the font size
  - Change the font family
  - Change parser options (like enabling/disabling GFM)
- **Optimizations/QoL**
  - Lazy render markdown (only rerender when the markdown changes)
    - This is a bit tricky because I would need a way to sourcemap the markdown to the rendered `html`, which is nontrivial.
  - Scroll sync between the markdown and the rendered `html`
    - Again, this probably requires sourcemapping the markdown to the rendered `html`.
  - Extend/rewrite some of the parsing rules to tag the `html` elements with classes for easier styling
    - This would allow for more advanced styling options and also remove the need for the hacky `css` overrides I have in place for things like inline code blocks.
